New adapter: ECPay 綠界 (B2C 電子發票 2.0). Implements the unified
`InvoiceProvider` (issue/void/allowance/voidAllowance/query) over ECPay's
AES-128-CBC JSON API — a third provider with yet another wire format
(`JSON → PHP urlencode → AES-128 → Base64` Data field inside a TransCode/RtnCode
envelope, Items as a JSON array, no CheckMacValue). Adds the 延遲/觸發開立
two-phase (DelayIssue → TriggerIssue) and 手機條碼/愛心碼 carrier validation
(CARRIER_VALIDATION capability), per-field issue validation with the business
rules confirmed live (amount sum, paper vs carrier, donation), keyword-based
RtnCode error mapping, the public `ECPAY_SANDBOX` credentials, MSW tests covering
success and error paths, and an env-gated live suite verified end-to-end on the
ECPay stage environment. 100% statement/function/line coverage.
